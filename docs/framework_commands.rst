Commands Package
================

This package acts almost identically to :doc:`discord.ext.commands <dpy:ext/commands/api>`; i.e.
they both have the same attributes. Some of these attributes, however, have been slightly modified,
as outlined below.

    :members:

.. autoclass:: redbot.core.commands.Group
