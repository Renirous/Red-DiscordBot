Commands Package

This package acts almost identically to ``discord.ext.commands``; i.e. they both have the same

.. autofunction:: redbot.core.commands.command

.. autofunction:: redbot.core.commands.group

.. autoclass:: redbot.core.commands.Command
    :members:

.. autoclass:: redbot.core.commands.Group
