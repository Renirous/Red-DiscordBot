Installing Red on CentOS 7
==========================

.. warning:: For safety reasons, DO NOT install Red with a root user. Instead, `make a new one <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Step_by_Step_Guide/s1-starting-create-account.html>`_.

----------------------
Setting up an instance
----------------------

Run :code:`redbot-setup` and follow the prompts. It will ask first for where you want to
store the data (the default is :code:`~/.local/share/Red-DiscordBot`) and will then ask
for confirmation of that selection. Next, it will ask you to choose your storage backend
(the default here is JSON). It will then ask for a name for your instance. This can be
anything as long as it does not contain spaces; however, keep in mind that this is the
name you will use to run your bot, and so it should be something you can remember.

-----------
Running Red
-----------

Run :code:`redbot <your instance name>` and run through the initial setup. This will ask for
your token and a prefix.
